```

## VARA FM Configuration
When connecting VARA to Winlink:
- Host: localhost
- Control Port: 8300
- Data Port: 8301

## Notes
- Scripts automatically install Wine and all dependencies
- VARA FM and RMS Packet share the same Wine prefix (`~/.wine-winlink`)

- Always start VARA FM before Winlink if using them together

## License
Scripts are free to use. VARA and Winlink software have their own licensing terms.

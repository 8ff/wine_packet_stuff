## Download the scripts

- Without Git (easiest): On the repo page, click the green "Code" button â†’ "Download ZIP". Unzip it, then open a terminal inside the unzipped `wine_packet_stuff` folder.
- With Git:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/8ff/wine_packet_stuff.git
  cd wine_packet_stuff
  ```
Then follow Quick Start below.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x *.sh

# Install VARA FM
./setup-vara.sh

# Install Winlink Express (most users want this)
./setup-winlink-express.sh

# Launch programs
./launch-vara-fm.sh
./launch-winlink-express.sh
```

## VARA FM Configuration
When connecting VARA to Winlink:
- Host: localhost
- Control Port: 8300
- Data Port: 8301

## Notes
- Scripts automatically install Wine and all dependencies
- VARA FM and RMS Packet share the same Wine prefix (`~/.wine-winlink`)
- Winlink Express uses a separate prefix (`~/.wine-winlink-express`)
- Always start VARA FM before Winlink if using them together

## License
Scripts are free to use. VARA and Winlink software have their own licensing terms.
